# Travel Booking System with Qt and Dijkstra’s Algorithm

## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive travel booking system developed using the Qt framework, providing an immersive GUI for a smooth and intuitive user experience. The system allows users to book flights or cruises between different countries, while optimizing costs and routes. It incorporates Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path between locations, ensuring the most efficient travel routes and fare calculations. Additionally, it includes a user account system with authentication, balance management, and credit card information, making it a secure and versatile platform for travel reservations.

## Key Features

### 1. Booking Flights and Cruises Across Countries
- The system enables users to book flights or cruises for trips across various countries.
- Users can choose between different modes of travel, such as air or sea, based on availability and preferences.
- Each booking includes essential details like departure and arrival locations, travel time, and associated costs.

### 2. Shortest Path Calculation with Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- To provide the most efficient travel experience, the system uses Dijkstra’s algorithm to compute the shortest path between selected destinations.
- The algorithm dynamically calculates the optimal route based on distances between countries, which are represented as nodes and edges in a graph data structure.
- Ticket prices are determined by the calculated distances, ensuring fair and distance-proportional pricing for each trip.

### 3. Authenticated User Accounts with Balance and Credit Card Integration
- Users can create accounts with personal information and payment methods securely managed within the system.
- Account authentication includes unique usernames and passwords, with each user having an associated balance for travel expenses.
- Users can add and manage credit card information, with secure handling of sensitive data.
- The system tracks users' balance and transactions, allowing users to make payments, add funds, and view transaction history.

### 4. Reward System with Bonuses for Frequent Travelers
- A reward system incentivizes frequent travel by offering bonuses for each trip booked through the platform.
- After each booking, users earn points or receive discounts that can be applied to future reservations.
- This feature encourages users to use the platform consistently, benefiting from reduced prices over time.

### 5. Immersive and Intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- The GUI, built with Qt’s widgets and components, provides an engaging and user-friendly interface.
- The main interface includes clear, interactive menus for navigation, booking options, and account management.
- Interactive maps and visual cues enhance the booking experience, allowing users to visualize routes and select destinations easily.
- Smooth transitions, modern design elements, and accessible layouts make the application visually appealing and highly usable.
